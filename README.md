# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
I have created this project on basic knowledge of Computer vision and Face recogniition module. As it suggest that whenever a person comes and show up her or his face in camera then it recognizes the person and matches with
its database. If that person is saved in their database then attendance will get marked in the excel sheet which will be helpful for the organization to maintain its employee database. 
GUI can be shown for the various technigues we can do with this project.
